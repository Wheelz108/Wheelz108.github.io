					<p> Hi, my name is Lachlan O'Neill, I'm 17 and I live in Queensland, more specifically, Brisbane, I work as an administrator for a disability support company on the Gold Coast. I graduated Year 12 last year. I was originally going to study a diploma of Software Development at TAFE and then continue with a Bachelor of IT with QUT afterwards, but I thought I might as well try and apply for the qualification through OUA anyway, so here I am. Some of my hobbies include video games, Dungeons and Dragons and reading. </p>

					<p> Some of my favourite video games are Super Smash Bros. Melee, Dragonball Fighterz and Pokemon, I play all three of these competitively which might have something to do with my feelings towards them. I bought Persona 5 on the PS3 back in March and it quickly became one of my favourites as well, I completed it in a week! It's soundtrack is a complete bop the whole way through. That was actually the main reason I bought it! </p>

					<p> I have Cerebral Palsy so I'm dependent on a wheelchair, it limits my capabilities somewhat, but I'm not to restricted in everyday activities, it's physical activity I have a hard time in. Which might explain my choice in hobbies, also my gamertag Wheelz! Honestly though, my disability isn't too limiting to me, I have a knack for finding ways I can do things.</p>

						<p> I think my ideal job is something to do with software or web development. Really anything to do with coding, that's where my main interest is in IT. I don't know what exactly I want to do, but that's a good start right? I've learnt quite a few languages in my spare time; Python, Java, Javascript, HTML and CSS (really coming in handy here lmao), C#, and Assembly. I originally wanted to go into the security part of IT but it was all very daunting to a beginner, it's still an interest of mine though. </p>

					<p> The Myers Briggs personality test is wildly inconsistant and imprecise. While it can nail someone's peronality on the head the first time they take the test, future results will vary wildly for the same person depending on where they are in their life at that moment. Personally I have taken it at least three times at different points in my life, once at the beginning of high school, once at the end, and once now for this profile. My results in order were: Logician (INTP), Mediator (INFP) and Advocate (INFJ). </p>

					<p> The Big Five personality test is a much more precise and accurate gauge of a person's personality traits. The test uses five distinct criteria to catergorise people, those being Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism. Often these criteria are shortened to the acronym OCEAN. According to my test results I'm less than 5% extraverted which I expected. But I didn't expect the percentages of the other traits, especially how neurotic I apparently am. But to be honest I don't care about these results too much. </p>

					<p> The DISC Assessment is commonly used by employers to gauge potential employees on which roles they would fit in a team. This test uses four criteria to gauge the examinee's personality; Dominance, Influence, Steadiness and Conscientiousness. Here in this test my highest scoring traits are my dominance and compliance and influence is my lowest at only 7%. </p>

					<p> To be completely honest, I don't give a damn about these results. They quantify my personality sure, but I already know who I am. It's not like taking those test magically generates a personality or anything. They just give you a reason to justify the behaviour of bad people in my opinion. While you might be forced to take these test by a HR department or whatever, but I feel that you'll get a much better gauge on a person's mannerisms and personality by working with them or being around them rather than going off of the results of some dumb test. </p>
