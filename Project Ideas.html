			<p> Here, I'll explain some project ideas I would eventually like to work on in my spare time or during the course of my study. </p>
			
			<ul> <! An unordered list tag, just to list some ideas I have. I could have used an ordered list as well, but I felt this one fit better >
				
				<li> I want to make a simple text-based RPG at some point. </li>

				<li> I want to develop this website further and add more features, maybe some more complex things like a Javascript animation that plays when the website is loaded. </li>
				
				<li> I would like to develop an Android APK of some description, I don't have any ideas for it yet though... </li>
				
				<li> I also just want to advance my knowledge of programming in general, maybe learn some new languages or something, I don't know. </li>
				
			</ul>
			
			<p> I've already tried to make a small RPG, but it wasn't very good and it was extremely buggy, I remember it has a simple movement system, just an x,y counter that updated whenever the player pressed any of the WASD keys. But the counter would only update whenever it received two inputs, so you could only move two steps at a time. Really bad if you wanted to get somewhere precise. </p>
			
			<p> Hopefully, next time I try to make something similar, it doesn't flip out like that. I don't think I could have done anything to fix it though. That system was one of the first things I implemented and that bug only started happening as the game got bigger, I think somewhere around 1000 lines of code? So it might have been a problem with the language itself rather than any of my code. You can never be too sure though. </p>
			
			<p> As this website develops maybe I could add some demos of stuff I'm working on. Perhaps I could add a version of the RPG onto the site, you never know. I don't really know how to do stuff like that though, I guess I could embed the file using HTML or something, but I'm not too sure on how to get it to run within the website... I guess that's something I could learn in the course of my study at RMIT. </p>
			
			<p> I've also developed an Android APK before, it was just a really basic PONG clone that I made for my Year 11 IT assessment, but it was done using MIT's Android App Inventor which uses block coding. I despised working with that software,and if I were to develop an Android app again I'd use an actual programming language rather than stupid block coding. I hated that assignment. 0/10 never again. </p>

			<p> I'm actually in the middle of developing a game at the moment. I've got a small team consisting of me, two other programmers, a writer and an artist. It's past the first papaer prototyping stage and I'm in the middle of developing the first prototype in C-Sharp's console interface. </p>

			<p> To give a brief summary it's a turn-based RPG, you and your enemy have a team of six party members with three on the field at a time. Each action you perform adds to a 'point' counter and at the end of the round each side's points are tallyed up and the side with the least points goes first next round. </p>

			<p> Right now the only actions each person can perform is an attack action and a unique action specific to that character, some of these include healing party members, halving damage taken, having a chance to dodge an attack etc. </p>

			<p> To be honest it's rather complex, but I'm almost finished this prototype, so we'll see where the idea goes from there. </p>

			<h1 style="text-shadow: -2px 0 black, 0 2px black, 2px 0 black, 0 -2px black; text-align: center; color: white; border-radius: 20px; padding: 20px; margin: 20px; font-family: 'earwig_factoryregular'; font-size: 2em;"> Potential Project Report </h1>

			<p> My project idea is a simple tool to assist with competitive Pokemon battling. It will be used for the quick generation of competition ready Pokemon, they can then be imported into the existing Pokemon battle simulator Pokemon Showdown or imported into existing game save files using another program called PKHex. PKHex is an existing tool that allows for the modification of Pokemon game save files, from Red and Blue on the Gameboy to the latest game (Sword and Shield on the Nintendo Switch as of the time of writing). You can modify the items in your bag, your money, the Pokemon in your possession etc. PKHex will also ensure that the Pokemon you are generating are legal, in other words that they would be able to be legitimately encountered in game. If the Pokemon you generate are illegal in any way, such as having illegal moves, abilities or stats Nintendo will detect the generated Pokemon as being illegitimately obtained (i.e. hacked in) and will subsequently ban you from the Pokemon online servers. </p>

			<p> My tool would greatly benefit the competitive Pokemon community as it takes a very long time to breed for a competition ready Pokemon in the game alone. Just getting the IVs you need can take ages, let alone EVs, natures, moves and battle items. To be fair though, Game Freak have made huge strides in lowering the barrier for entry into competition, they’ve implemented mechanics to make the desired natures, EVs, and IVs easier to obtain with mint items, Super Training and Hyper Training respectively. But breeding for moves and getting the held items necessary are still needlessly tedious so my tool will help immensely. </p>

			<p> I could realistically develop my tool in three languages, Python, C# or Java. I’ve been using Java recently so I may use it. C# and Java are very similar in syntax so I could use C# as well. But I haven’t used C# in ages, so I think Java is my language of choice for this project, especially because I’ve been using Java as a part of Programming 1. </p>

			<p> There are downsides to using Java however, one major downside is the strain on the computer. Java doesn’t compile directly into machine code for execution. First it compiles into bytecode which the Java Runtime Environment interprets and converts to machine code before execution. For smaller programs such as my tool, this shouldn’t be an issue, but for larger projects this can be a major downside and as such most large-scale projects tend to stay far away from Java. There are a few notable exceptions though, Minecraft being one example I can think of from the top of my head. </p>

			<p> My project will generate Pokemon as plain text files in the format described below: </p>

			<ul style="list-style-type: none; font-family: monospace; font-size: 20px;">

				<li> Species (Gender) @ Item </li>

				<li> IVs (If specified): # Stat / # Stat / # Stat </li>

				<li> EVs: # Stat / # Stat / # Stat / # Stat </li>

				<li> Ability: Ability Name </li>

				<li> Shiny: (Yes/No) </li>

				<li> (Nature Name) Nature </li>

				<li> - Move 1 </li>

				<li> - Move 2 </li>

				<li> - Move 3 </li>

				<li> - Move 4 </li>
			
			</ul>

			<p> This format is officially supported by PKHex and Pokemon Showdown and is widely used in the community to quickly and easily write out competitive sets and modify them just as easily. People will often post sets on forums then others will offer criticism and take these sets and use them in their own teams. Advantages of this format include readability, easy evaluation tweaking and modification and widespread adoption. </p>

			<p> My tool will allow users to choose from any of the 890 existing Pokemon and customise everything from their stat distributions to their moves and abilities to their held items and nickname. Then the program will output these Pokemon in the format showcased above which can then be imported into save files with PKHex or used online immediately in Pokemon Showdown. </p>

			<p> To realise this project we’ll need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), my preferred development environment is Visual Studio Code a free, fully featured IDE with community-maintained support for every major language out there through modular plugins. For the development of this tool we’ll be using Java as stated above. The reason for this choice being; this is a small project so Java’s downsides of not having a machine code compiler won’t be as important and two; it’s the language I’ve been using most recently. It should be noted that for users to be able to import teams into official games, they will need either a 3DS (for Pokemon Diamond, Pearl and Platinum through to Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon) or a Nintendo Switch (for Sword and Shield) with custom firmware, the guides for installing Luma3DS or Atmosphere for Switch will be linked <a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide" style="text-decoration: none; font-family: p5hattyregular; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">here</a> and <a href="https://nh-server.github.io/switch-guide/" style="text-decoration: none; font-family: p5hattyregular; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">here</a>. </p>

			<p> If the project successfully comes to fruition, I will be directly impacted considering I play Pokemon competitively, but if, and this is a big if; if I choose to release this tool to the community I feel that it’ll have a huge impact. It’ll lower the barrier of entry for new players, and help veteran players speed up the process of theory-crafting, testing and experimenting with different teams, setups and strategies. Using the Pokemon Showdown battle simulator users will be able to take theoretical teams and put them into the ladder system for testing, then they can either go back and change the team to synergise better or, if their satisfied, import the team into the official games using PKHex and Luma3DS custom firmware, and then use then on Nintendo’s official ladder ranking or just use them in battles with friends. This will make the process of creating competition ready Pokemon much easier than before, rather than having to set up complex breeding chains and sink hundreds of hours into the game you can just input a few things, generate a text file put it in PKHex then put it into your game.</p>
