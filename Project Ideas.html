			<p> Here, I'll explain some project ideas I would eventually like to work on in my spare time or during the course of my study. </p>
			
			<ul> <! An unordered list tag, just to list some ideas I have. I could have used an ordered list as well, but I felt this one fit better >
				
				<li> I want to make a simple text-based RPG at some point. </li>
				<li> I want to develop this website further and add more features, maybe some more complex things like a Javascript animation that plays when the website is loaded. </li>
				<li> I would like to develop an Android APK of some description, I don't have any ideas for it yet though... </li>
				<li> I also just want to advance my knowledge of programming in general, maybe learn some new languages or something, I don't know. </li>
				
			</ul>
			
			<p> I've already tried to make a small RPG, but it wasn't very good and it was extremely buggy, I remember it has a simple movement system, just an x,y counter that updated whenever the player pressed any of the WASD keys. But the counter would only update whenever it received two inputs, so you could only move two steps at a time. Really bad if you wanted to get somewhere precise. </p>
			
			<p> Hopefully, next time I try to make something similar, it doesn't flip out like that. I don't think I could have done anything to fix it though. That system was one of the first things I implemented and that bug only started happening as the game got bigger, I think somewhere around 1000 lines of code? So it might have been a problem with the language itself rather than any of my code. You can never be too sure though. </p>
			
			<p> As this website develops maybe I could add some demos of stuff I'm working on. Perhaps I could add a version of the RPG onto the site, you never know. I don't really know how to do stuff like that though, I guess I could embed the file using HTML or something, but I'm not too sure on how to get it to run within the website... I guess that's something I could learn in the course of my study at RMIT. </p>
			
			<p> I've also developed an Android APK before, it was just a really basic PONG clone that I made for my Year 11 IT assessment, but it was done using MIT's Android App Inventor which uses block coding. I despised working with that software,and if I were to develop an Android app again I'd use an actual programming language rather than stupid block coding. I hated that assignment. 0/10 never again. </p>
